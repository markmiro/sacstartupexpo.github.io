        small When you’re expecting to go
      p This is a semi-informal event in order to foster a sense of community for Sacramento startups of all sizes- from napkin sketch to IPO! 
      p Networking- What cool companies are starting up right next door? Get off your couch and onto the Sacramento Startup wave!
      p Lightning talks (Themed)- The Lightning talks for this expo will actually be Sacramento Game developers showing off their games that they made. They will be judged by a very distinguished panel of Judges (including the CEO of 5th Planet Games Rob Winkler) 
      p Expo- As always if you are a startup who has moved past the napkin phase and you'd like to showcase your product or company, just show up with your brochures, your laptop, and your swag. We will have a table ready for you!
